(** * Classic list functions *)

(* The trio of "map/filter/reduce" are commonly presented as workhorse
 * *higher-order functions* for lists.  That is, they are functions that take
 * functions as arguments. *)

(* [map] runs a function on every position of a list to make a new list. *)
Fixpoint map {A B} (f : A -> B) (ls : list A) : list B :=
  match ls with
  | nil => nil
  | x :: ls' => f x :: map f ls'
  end.

Compute map (fun n => n + 2) [1; 3; 8].
(* Note the use of an *anonymous function* above via [fun]. *)

(* [filter] keeps only those elements of a list that pass a Boolean test. *)
Fixpoint filter {A} (f : A -> bool) (ls : list A) : list A :=
  match ls with
  | nil => nil
  | x :: ls' => if f x then x :: filter f ls' else filter f ls'
  end.

Compute filter (fun n => if n <=? 3 then true else false) [1; 3; 8].
(* The [if ... then true else false] bit might seem wasteful.  Actually, the
 * [<=?] operator has a fancy type that needs converting to [bool].  We'll get
 * more specific about such types in a future class. *)

(* [fold_left], a relative of "reduce," repeatedly applies a function to all
 * elements of a list. *)
Fixpoint fold_left {A B} (f : B -> A -> B) (ls : list A) (acc : B) : B :=

  | nil => acc
  | x :: ls' => fold_left f ls' (f acc x)

(* Let's use these classics to implement a few simple "database queries" on the

Compute map Name languages.
